## Overview
In this work we present a novel method to enhance the performance of Language Model Models (LLMs) **using only their outputs**. In contrast to reranking approaches, we employ a small model, the LM-Corrector (LMCor) to combine and edit diverse candidate outputs generated by LLMs, resulting in superior quality outputs.
